This has been a monstrous undertaking and I'm both sad and excited to see it come to an end. 

For this final project I wanted to go out with a bang and make a better version of my first
project, which was a turned based rpg game. I figured I had more than a week, I could go hog wild.
I love top-down old-school rpgs, so it made sense.
